# Java FSE 4.0 – Core Hands-On Repository (CTS)
Collection of Java-based practical exercises completed as part of the Full Stack Engineer (FSE) track under the DN 4.0 initiative at Cognizant (CTS). 

## Learning Objectives

- Implement and apply standard design patterns using Java
- Demonstrate understanding of data structures including arrays, lists, and maps
- Apply algorithmic logic in Java to solve problem statements
- Perform CRUD operations using collections and basic JDBC
- Develop simple modular components using core Java syntax and OOP principles

## Project Module - 1

### Design Principles & Patterns

1. Singleton Pattern – Centralized instance-based logging  
2. Factory Method Pattern – Dynamic creation of different document types  

### Data structures and Algorithms

1. E-commerce Search Function –  Linear and Binary Search with time complexity analysis
2. Financial Forecasting - Predict revenue using historical data(Moving Average/Regression)

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open each module directory in your preferred IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ).
3. Refer to the README file or comments provided within each Java file for instructions.
4. Compile and run the main or test classes to observe the implementation and verify expected output.

## Technologies Utilized

1. Java 8+
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts  
3. Java Collections Framework  
4. Algorithm implementation and recursion  
5. Commonly used design patterns
